I´m Ana from Colombia and I used to work in test equipment development (sequence programming) with TestStand and LabView, but I also have professional experience with Python and have privately educated myself with courses in web development with Django and Python. From January 23 to April 18, I'm doing a bootcamp as a fullstack developer with Java from Neuefische.
